# File Management Automation

This project is a C++ utility designed to automate the process of organizing files based on their types within a specified directory. The tool categorizes files into three main folders: `pdf`, `images`, and `videos`, based on their extensions. The goal of the program is to streamline file organization, making it easier to manage large sets of files in a structured manner.

## Features

- Automatically moves `.pdf` files into a `pdf` folder.
- Moves image files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`) into an `images` folder.
- Moves video files (e.g., `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mkv`) into a `videos` folder.
- Supports user input for the target directory.
- Simple and efficient file handling.

## Requirements

- C++17 or later
- A C++ compiler that supports the `<filesystem>` library (GCC 8 or later)
  
## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-management-automation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd file-management-automation
Compile the program: If you're using a supported C++ compiler, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
g++ -std=c++17 -o file_organizer file_organizer.cpp
Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
./file_organizer
How to Use
When prompted, enter the path to the directory you want to organize. Example:

text
Copy
Edit
Enter the directory path (e.g., D:/Documents):
The program will automatically:

Create pdf, images, and videos folders if they don't exist.
Move the respective files into their correct folders based on their extensions.
The file organization process will run until all eligible files are sorted.

Supported File Types
PDF Files: .pdf
Image Files: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif
Video Files: .mp4, .avi, .mkv
